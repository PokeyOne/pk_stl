* Introduction

pk_stl is a Rust library for reading and writing STL files, and has no additional
dependencies other than the standard library. It can read and write both ASCII
and binary STL files (eventually; see section below).

** STL File Support

There are two main STL file formats: binary and ascii. This library will
eventually support both formats full, however as this is in *very* early
development, both are not fully supported yet.

|       | Binary | ASCII |
|-------+--------+-------|
| Read  | Yes    | No    |
| Write | No     | Yes   |
